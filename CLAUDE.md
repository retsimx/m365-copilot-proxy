Working guidance for this repo lives in **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — read it first.

Start with the **Operating principles (read first)** and **How we work —
hypothesis-driven** sections. In short:

1. Always run sequentially — one thread at a time; the rate limit tracks
   threads-started, not messages (upstream returns explicit `PerScenarioThrottled`).
   Shielded by a 30m circuit-breaker cooldown baseline and 15s new-session pacing queue.
2. Chase all hunches — tangents to test any idea are encouraged; test, don't guess.
3. The end goal is always a usable agent in **pi or openclaw**.
4. Be scientific: hypothesize → predict → test → conclude (log it in
   `docs/hypotheses.md`).
5. Prompt tinkering: try **N wildly different** strategies at once, A/B them in one
   bench sweep, and let the data pick the direction — never iterate on the first idea.
